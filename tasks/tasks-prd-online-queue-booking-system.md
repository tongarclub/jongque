### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `BookingForm.tsx` and `BookingForm.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npm test` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
- This is a Next.js 14+ project using App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Prisma ORM, and NextAuth.js

### OAuth Configuration Requirements

For OAuth integration (Task 2.2), the following will be needed:

**Google OAuth:**
- Google Cloud Console project setup
- OAuth 2.0 Client ID and Client Secret
- Authorized redirect URIs configuration
- Environment variables: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`

**Facebook OAuth:**
- Facebook Developer App creation
- App ID and App Secret configuration
- Valid OAuth redirect URIs setup
- Environment variables: `FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID`, `FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET`

**LINE Login:**
- LINE Developers Console channel setup
- Channel ID and Channel Secret configuration
- Callback URL registration
- Environment variables: `LINE_CLIENT_ID`, `LINE_CLIENT_SECRET`

**Current Status:** OAuth providers are configured in `lib/auth.ts` but require proper client credentials and testing.
